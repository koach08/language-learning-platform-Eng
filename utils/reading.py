The effects of climate change are already visible. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods, are becoming more frequent and severe. Sea levels are rising, threatening coastal communities. Many species are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing conditions.

However, there is hope. Countries around the world are taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are becoming more affordable and widespread. Many businesses are adopting sustainable practices, and individuals are making changes in their daily lives to reduce their carbon footprint.

The Paris Agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, represents a global commitment to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. While challenges remain, international cooperation and technological innovation offer pathways to a more sustainable future.

Young people are playing a crucial role in this movement, demanding action from governments and corporations. Their activism has helped raise awareness and push climate change to the top of the political agenda in many countries.""",

        "text": """Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the way we learn. From personalized tutoring to automated grading, AI tools are being used in classrooms around the world.

One of the biggest benefits of AI in education is personalization. AI systems can analyze how each student learns and adapt lessons to their needs. If a student struggles with a concept, the AI can provide extra practice. If they master it quickly, they can move on to more challenging material.

AI can also help teachers save time. Grading essays and tests takes many hours, but AI tools can do this work quickly. This gives teachers more time to focus on helping students directly.

However, there are concerns about AI in education. Some worry that too much screen time is bad for children. Others are concerned about privacy and data security. There are also questions about whether AI can truly replace human teachers.

Despite these challenges, AI will likely play an increasingly important role in education. The key is to use these tools wisely, combining the best of technology with the irreplaceable human elements of teaching.""",

        "text": """The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way many people work. Millions of employees around the world started working from home, and many continue to do so today.

Remote work has several advantages. Workers save time and money by not commuting. They often have more flexibility to balance work and personal life. Many people report being more productive when working from home.

Companies also benefit from remote work. They can save money on office space and hire talented people from anywhere in the world. This has led to more diverse and global teams.

However, remote work also has challenges. Some workers feel isolated and miss the social interaction of an office. Communication can be more difficult when teams are not in the same place. It can also be hard to separate work from personal life when your home is your office.

Many companies are now adopting "hybrid" models, where employees work some days in the office and some days from home. This approach tries to combine the benefits of both remote and in-person work.""",

==============================
MANDATORY DESIGN RULES — follow strictly:

1. PARAPHRASE REQUIRED
   - The correct answer must NOT copy words/phrases directly from the article.
   - Rephrase using synonyms or different sentence structures.
   - This prevents students from answering by simple keyword matching.

2. PLAUSIBLE DISTRACTORS
   - Each wrong option must be believable to someone who skimmed or half-read the article.
   - Wrong options may use words FROM the article but in incorrect combinations.
   - Do NOT include obviously absurd or grammatically broken options.

3. ONE CLEARLY CORRECT ANSWER
   - Avoid questions where multiple options could be defended.
   - For inference questions: the answer must follow ONLY from the article content, not from general knowledge.

4. NO COMMON-KNOWLEDGE ANSWERS
   - Every question must require actually reading this specific text to answer correctly.

==============================
QUESTION TYPE DISTRIBUTION (strictly follow this ratio):
  - 1 question  → main_idea             : What is the overall message/purpose of the article?
  - 2 questions → detail                : Explicitly stated in the text, but answer must be PARAPHRASED
  - 1 question  → inference             : Implied but not directly stated; requires reading between the lines
  - 1 question  → vocabulary_in_context : Meaning of a word/phrase as used in THIS article

TYPE-SPECIFIC RULES:
  detail      : Correct answer paraphrases the text. Wrong options use article words in wrong context.
  inference   : Must NOT be answerable from common knowledge alone. Base reasoning on specific content.
  vocabulary  : Ask about a word with a non-obvious contextual meaning. Distractors = other common meanings.
